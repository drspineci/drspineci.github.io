     <h1>More about my projects</h1>
        <p>This is me, Spineci Cosmin and this is my life and project</p>
<p>
I was born in Buzau, Romania, eastern Europe. 
</p>
<p>
I have failed at many things.
</p>
<p>
I tried to become a football player. I always ended in defense. 
</p>
<p>I tried to become a professional diplomat, before politician. I started to swear and made phoney gags over the internet and i am very disapointed. 
</p>
<p>
I tried to become a researcher, i ended up with a politician, but i did not have enough time to purpouse that mathematics, so i started. 
</p>
<p>
I discovered i loved computer science and computers. Programming, data and intelligence. I love running, doing research for id without a scheduele so if you need help please give me a call.
